JavaScript Basics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript is lightweight interpreted and single threaded language which is used to create dynamic content for web pages.

We can declare variables in 3 ways
var -> can be redeclared, reassigned , function scoped and can be hoisted and initialized with undefined in hoisting.
let -> can be reassigned but cannot be redeclared , Hoisted but in TDZ and cannnot be accessed before initialization
const -> is mostly used to declare constants cannot be reassigned and redeclared.and also hoisted in TDZ.

Data Types
Primitive : Numnber , String,Boolean ,Null, undefined , Symbol, Bigint
Non Primitive : Array,Object,function , date

Type Conversion
let s = "123";
let n = Number(s);  // Converts string to number
console.log(n);

Type Coercion 
Automatically Conversion of one data type to another. Also known as implicit type conversion.
Example : 
console.log(1 + "2");   // "12"   (number → string)
console.log("6" - 2);   // 4      (string → number)
console.log("6" * "2"); // 12     (both strings → numbers)


Type Conversion 
Conversion of one data type to another manually by user. Also known as explicit type conversion.

== vs ===
== ->  compares only the data not their types (kind of its loose equality check)
=== -> compares data types also and no Coercion happens (strict equality check)

Hoisting
Automatically declarations are moved to top of scope.
var -> hoisted and initialized with undefined
let / const -> hoisted but uninitialized
Function declarations -> fully hoisted with body

Objects in JavaScript
A collection of key value pairs. Keys are called properties.


Arrays in JavaScript
Arrays in JavaScript are ordered list of values. They ae used to store multiple values into a single variable.
In js arrays are heterogeneous.We can store multiple values of different data types in an array.
Creation of array can be done using two ways 
 -> using array literals []
 -> using new keyword (Constructor)
