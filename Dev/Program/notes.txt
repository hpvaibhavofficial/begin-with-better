Inheritance
is a mechanism of acquiring properties and behaviour of one class to another. In java we use extends keyword to inherit properties.
Inheritance is basically 'IS A' relationship. Child Class is a Parent Class.
Basicallly it supports code reusability.
Also Inheritance have a lot of keywords involved like super,this.
super -> keyword used to access parent class variables and constructors.(This keyword cannot be direcly used inside the class. We can use it inside a method or constructor.)
this -> refers to current class instance. Used to refers class members methods or constructors.

Rules
We cannot inherit private and final class.
static and final members can be inherited but cannot be overriden.
private members cannot be inherited.
protected members can be inherited and remains protected in child class.

Types of Inheritance
-> Single Inheritance
-> Multilevel Inheritance
-> Hierarchial Inheritance
-> Hybrid Inheritance 


Encapsulation :
is the process of wrapping the data members and methods into a single unit.
It basically aims at restricting the data access directly from other class and accessing it via some public methods.
This ensures the data hiding , controlled access to class members.

Abstraction 
is a key feature of OOP which aims at hiding the implementation and showing only the essential features. 
It can be acheived using two ways
abstract classes
interfaces

Abstract Classes
are those classes which cannot  be instantiated directly.It is Basically  a partially implemented class which can have both abstract and non abstract methods. It is declared using abstract keyword followed by classname. Also the abstract methods must have abstract keyword.

These classes are meant to be inherited by some other class.These classes define some set of functionality which inheritable class must follow.
