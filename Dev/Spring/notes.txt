Java is widely used as a server-side programming language in enterprise applications, web development, and microservices.

Servelet : Java Servelets are java classes that runs on a server and handles client requests and responses.They basically handles behind the scene logics.

Java Servelet supports all kind of protocols but primiraly it is most often used with Http protocols (a set of rules for web communication such as requesting and delivering pages).

JSP : Java Server Pages used to build dynamic web pages by embedding the Java code to HTML.
A  Jsp is slower than servelet because first step in JSP life cycle is to convert the JSP code to servelet code and then it compiles.
