Java is widely used as a server-side programming language in enterprise applications, web development, and microservices.

Servelet : Java Servelets are java classes that runs on a server and handles client requests and responses.They basically handles behind the scene logics.

Java Servelet supports all kind of protocols but primiraly it is most often used with Http protocols (a set of rules for web communication such as requesting and delivering pages).

JSP : Java Server Pages used to build dynamic web pages by embedding the Java code to HTML.
A  Jsp is slower than servelet because first step in JSP life cycle is to convert the JSP code to servelet code and then it compiles. 
JSP only accepts HTTP/HTTPs requests.

Initially, enterprise Java used Servlets and JSPs, which mixed business logic with presentation. Then EJB came to provide transactions, security, and distributed capabilities but was heavyweight and complex. Spring was introduced in 2002 as a lightweight, POJO-based alternative to simplify enterprise development.


MVC -> Model View Controller 
Model ->  Model represents the data and business logic.It is responsible for defining how the data is stored, retrieved and manipulated.
In spring Model basically includes the entity classes, DAO or Repository layer and business logic or servies.

View -> View is responsible for presenting the data to user screen. It basically displays the info given by controller usually a web page or UI component.It does not contain any business logic. It handles the presentation part.

Controller -> Controller basically is responsible for handling user requests, processing input and coordinating between the model and view. It acts as a bridge between view and model. A client sends request and controller sends that request to service / model and then it sends response to user.
