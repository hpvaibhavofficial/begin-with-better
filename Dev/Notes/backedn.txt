Initialization of a Project

1. npm init -y → initialize project
2. Create folders: public, src → inside src: models, controllers, middlewares, utils, db, routes
3. Create files: src/index.js, src/app.js, src/constants.js
4. Create .env file at root → add PORT and MONGODB_URI
5. Install dependencies → express, mongoose, dotenv
6. Install dev dependencies → nodemon, prettier
7. Add "dev": "nodemon src/index.js" in package.json scripts
8. Create .prettierrc file → configure tab/spacing rules
9. In constants.js → export DB_NAME
10. In db/index.js → import mongoose, connect with process.env.MONGODB_URI + DB_NAME, export dbConnect
11. In index.js → import dotenv, call dotenv.config(), import dbConnect, call dbConnect()
12. Run project with npm run dev
