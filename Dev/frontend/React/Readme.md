# React 
React is a javascript library which is used to create User Interfaces and mostly to create single page applications.

It was created by Facebook. <br>
React basically used component based architecture which helps it in building fast, dynamic and complex UIs in a stuctured and reusable way.

## Setting Up Environment
Initially we used to use CRA  to create React app which is now outdated.  
```bash 
npx create-react-app  app name              [Deprecated]
```
- It consumes more time and space during creation of app.It is a bulky utility and gives a lot of bundles which are unnecessary for beginers.


Now a days Vite is used to create react Apps
```bash 
npm create vite@latest app name           
```
