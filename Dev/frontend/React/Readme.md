# React 
React is a javascript library which is used to create User Interfaces and mostly to create single page applications.It was created by Facebook.
React basically used component based architecture which helps it in building fast, dynamic and complex UIs in a stuctured and reusable way.

React uses JSX (javascript XML) extension which allows us to write HTML code in javascript files.

## Setting Up Environment
Initially we used to use CRA  to create React app which is now outdated.  
```bash 
npx create-react-app  app name              [Deprecated]
```
- It consumes more time and space during creation of app.It is a bulky utility and gives a lot of bundles which are unnecessary for beginers.


Now a days Vite is used to create react Apps
```bash 
npm create vite@latest app name           
```

## Components based Architecture
React uses a component Based architecture which means our UI is broken into small independent and reusable blocks known as components.
