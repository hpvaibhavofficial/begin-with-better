Bipartite Graph
A type of graph whose nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that 
-> Every node connects a vertex in V to vertex IN U
-> No edge exist between vertices in same set .

Finding a Graph is Bipartite or Not .. ?
We can color a graph and if no two adjacent noedes have same color after coloring then graph is known as Bipartite.
Also a Linear Graph is always Bipartite.
A Graph having even length cycle is also a Bipartite Graph.

We can check it by BFS / DFS both.
